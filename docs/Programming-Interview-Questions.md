1.  Sort an array of strings and merge them into a single array in sorted order. (Amazon)

**Example**

**Input** - 

{"ABC","FGE","STRD","MRDGE"}, {"HDL","ERG","TGFG","VGFSGR"}, {"FGRH","DAFG","RWTRE","VCFFG"},{ "EWR", "FVFD", "JGHJ", "HDHTY"}

**Output** - 

{"ABC","DAFG", "ERG","EWR", "FGE", "FGRH","FVFD", "HDHTY", "HDL", "JGHJ","MRDGE","RWTRE","STRD","TGFG","VCFFG", "VGFSGR"}



2. Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single array with no duplicates (Microsoft)

Example

**Input:** 

array1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7 }, 

array2: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9 }

**Output:** 

{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}


3. Given a string with numbers and parentheses unpack it (Bloomberg)

Example: 

**Input 1:**

a2(b)c3(d)

**Output:**

a2bbcddd

**Input 2:**

2a3(b3(c))d

**Output:**

aabcccbcccd
