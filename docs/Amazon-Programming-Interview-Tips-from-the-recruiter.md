The coding challenge gives you 90 minutes to complete 2 questions, 1 moderate and 1 hard. Following this there is a 15 minute multiple choice related to our Leadership Principles. 

**A few things to note:**

There is a strategy for success when taking this onli
ne assessment. People who follow this typically do better!

- Solve the coding problem to pass the test/edge cases- this can be a brute force solution. The reason for this is that the test grades the code by testing the edge/test cases. 

- AFTER you are done solved a solution that passes the test/edge cases, THEN go back and optimize the solution. This is also important and is also graded.

- The cultural portion IS graded. Candidates have failed the assessment because of cultural multiple choice questions. I suggest reading the Amazon Leadership principles to help answer these questions. Here is a link to the Amazon Leadership Principles. 

- You can use any of the following languages you’re comfortable with: C#, C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript.

- We are interested in your demonstration of problem solving, writing correct code, applying patterns/data structures, and optimizing for algorithmic performance on the tests.

**To best prepare for the online coding challenge, here are some resources:**

- Fundamentals: Go back and re-educate yourself on all data structures and data structure algorithms. They come up all the time. Understand all time and space complexity. Make sure you even get into more exotic things like hashmaps, b+trees (and variants), caches (and associated algorithms). You may want to visit www.codechef.com 

- Project Euler - http://projecteuler.net/ If you’ve been out of practice, complete up to problem 60 or so. You should be prompted to build useful libraries, which will help give practical experience for interview like problems. Don’t cheat or take shortcuts.

- Google Coding Contest has additional practice questions: http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html 

- Understand high scale architecture. Go look at how other big sites are structured: http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example
